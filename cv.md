## Briefly about myself:

I wanted to become a programmer since 8th grade. After graduating from 11th grade, I entered the **_"BREST STATE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY"_** for the speciality **_"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE"_**. During my studies at the university, I learned a lot, programmed in C# and C++, so I have at least some programming experience, I know many different algorithms, and I also improved my English a little.

Now I am a 2nd year student, the desire to create something of my own and learn something new has taken over, so I am on this course. I was very interested in the field of web development and specifically backend development. I love this tempting, hidden part of web development. I really want to learn how everything works under the hood and with this knowledge develop serious projects.

But before you start studying the backend, you need to understand what the frontend is, how it works and how to interact with it, you need to learn how to program in JavaScript, understand how the Internet works and what this “huge world” is. everything about, these are my goals for this course. I hope this knowledge will help me in my further knowledge in the field of web development.

**Search for the maximum element in the array:** the array "array" is given. Implement the function "FindMax", which will find the maximum element of the array.

```javascript
let array = [5, 1, 6, 8, 4, 10];

function FindMax(array) {
  let max = array[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (max < array[i]) {
      max = array[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

let max = FindMax(array);
```
